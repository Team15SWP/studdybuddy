# Quality Attribute Scenarios

## Reliability  
**Scenario:** Upon service restart (e.g., after an update), data is recovered and the system continues operating without any data loss.

## Availability  
**Scenario:** The service is available at least 99 % of the time during a calendar month (continuous operation, excluding scheduled maintenance).

## Security  
**Scenario 2:** When attempting to register with an email address that is already in use (even if a different password is provided), the server returns the message “Email already registered.”

## Usability  
**Scenario:** A new user completes registration and logs in within 3 minutes without any external guidance.

## Maintainability  
**Scenario:** Adding a new module or updating a dependency takes no more than 1 hour of developer effort, and all automated tests still pass successfully.

## Performance  
**Scenario:** The system processes 95 % of requests in 300 ms or less under normal load.

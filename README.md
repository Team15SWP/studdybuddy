## Project Story

Learning to program is equal parts *practice* and *pacing*.  Students often fall behind because they (a) don’t know which exercises match the current topic, or (b) not enough practice.

**StudyBuddy** solves both problems in one place:

1. **Auto‑curated practice** – Upload a course syllabus and the bot proposes relevant tasks for each lecture, from beginner to advanced.
2. **Real‑time checking & hints** – The built‑in evaluator runs submitted code in a sandbox and reports pass/fail, plus incremental hints.
3. **Progress tracker** – Tracks your overall practice progress, such as total number of problems solved.
4. **Smart reminders** – Customizable email notifications nudge students to practice just enough, right on schedule.

Together this forms a lightweight learning‑platform experience without the overhead of a full LMS.
